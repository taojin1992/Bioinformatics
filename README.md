# Global Sequence Alignment
This project will entail implementing the Global Sequence Alignment dynamic programming algorithm in Java (w/o using modules
containing these algorithms). The program should be able to align DNA and Protein sequences.

Use java -jar Lab_Term_Project_Jin_11474660_revised.jar to run it from the command line of Mac OS X.
